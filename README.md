## 🖥️ How to Run & View Output

Since this project outputs to the **Console**, you won't see text on the webpage itself. Follow these steps to view the results:

1.  **Open the File:** Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
2.  **Open Developer Tools:**
    * **Right-click** anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
    * *Or press `F12` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).*
3.  **Select the Console Tab:** Click on the "Console" tab in the developer window.
4.  **View Message:** You should see the message: *"Hello from JavaScript!"* (or similar).

## 💻 Code Preview

Here is how the JavaScript is linked and executed:

**HTML (index.html):**
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>

```

**JavaScript (script.js):**

```javascript
// This prints a message to the browser's hidden console
console.log("Hello, World! This is my first JS code.");

```
